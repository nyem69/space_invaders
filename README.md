# Explain Space Invader game

Space Invaders is a classic arcade game that was first released in 1978 by the Japanese company Taito. It is a simple, yet challenging game that has become a cultural icon of the video game industry.

In the game, the player controls a small spaceship at the bottom of the screen, and the objective is to defeat waves of invading alien spaceships. The aliens move back and forth across the top of the screen in a pattern, gradually getting closer to the player's ship. The player must shoot the aliens with the spaceship's lasers before they reach the bottom of the screen, which would result in the player losing a life.

The game is divided into multiple levels or "waves", each with its own set of alien ships to defeat. As the player progresses through the levels, the aliens become faster and more difficult to defeat. Additionally, there are also occasional "boss" enemies that require multiple hits to defeat.

To make the game even more challenging, the aliens will occasionally drop bombs that the player must dodge or destroy. The player's spaceship can also be destroyed by the aliens' lasers or by colliding with an alien ship.

Space Invaders was a revolutionary game for its time, introducing many of the gameplay mechanics that would become staples of the shoot-em-up genre. Its success paved the way for many other classic video games, and it remains a beloved and influential game to this day.

# Recreate this game in sveltekit

As an AI language model, I cannot perform actions on a computer, but I can provide you with some guidance on how to recreate the Space Invader game using SvelteKit.

Here are the steps you can follow:

Set up a SvelteKit project: You can start by creating a new SvelteKit project using the command line. You can use the "degenerate" template to create a simple project structure.

Create the game board: You will need to create a canvas element in your SvelteKit project that will serve as the game board. You can use HTML5 Canvas to create the game board.

Create the player's spaceship: You will need to create a player spaceship that can move left and right on the game board. You can use the keyboard arrow keys to control the movement of the player spaceship.

Create the enemy spaceships: You will need to create multiple enemy spaceships that move left and right across the game board. You can use a timer to control the movement of the enemy spaceships.

Create the player's laser: You will need to create a laser that the player can use to shoot down the enemy spaceships. You can use the space bar to fire the laser.

Create the enemy lasers: You will need to create lasers that the enemy spaceships can fire at the player's spaceship. You can use a timer to control the firing of the enemy lasers.

Detect collisions: You will need to detect collisions between the player's spaceship, the player's laser, the enemy spaceships, and the enemy lasers. You can use collision detection algorithms to detect collisions.

Keep score: You will need to keep track of the player's score as they shoot down enemy spaceships.

End the game: The game should end if the player's spaceship is hit by an enemy laser or if an enemy spaceship reaches the bottom of the game board.

Add sound effects: You can add sound effects to the game to make it more immersive and engaging. You can use the Web Audio API to play sound effects.

These are the basic steps you can follow to create the Space Invader game using SvelteKit. You can also add additional features to the game, such as power-ups and different levels, to make it more challenging and exciting.


# create sveltekit project

```
npm create svelte@latest space_invaders
cd space_invaders
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
```


# WRite the code to create the gameboard

Sure, here's an example code snippet to create a game board using SvelteKit:

```
<script>
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';
  
  let canvas;
  
  function createGameBoard() {
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    ctx.fillStyle = '#000'; // Set background color
    ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height); // Fill canvas with color
  }
  
  onMount(() => {
    createGameBoard();
  });
</script>

<canvas bind:this={canvas} width="600" height="400"></canvas>
```

This code creates a canvas element with a width of 600 pixels and a height of 400 pixels, and binds it to the canvas variable using SvelteKit's bind:this directive. The createGameBoard function is called on mount, which initializes the canvas context and fills the canvas with a black background color.

You can customize the canvas dimensions and background color to match your game's requirements.


# Create the player's spaceship

Certainly! Here's an example code snippet to create the player's spaceship using SvelteKit:

```
<script>
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';
  
  let canvas;
  let ctx;
  
  const PLAYER_WIDTH = 50;
  const PLAYER_HEIGHT = 30;
  
  let player = {
    x: canvas.width / 2 - PLAYER_WIDTH / 2,
    y: canvas.height - PLAYER_HEIGHT,
    speed: 5
  };
  
  function drawPlayer() {
    ctx.fillStyle = '#fff'; // Set player color
    ctx.fillRect(player.x, player.y, PLAYER_WIDTH, PLAYER_HEIGHT); // Draw player rectangle
  }
  
  function movePlayer(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowLeft' && player.x > 0) {
      player.x -= player.speed;
    } else if (event.key === 'ArrowRight' && player.x < canvas.width - PLAYER_WIDTH) {
      player.x += player.speed;
    }
  }
  
  onMount(() => {
    canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
    ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    window.addEventListener('keydown', movePlayer);
    drawPlayer();
  });
</script>

<canvas width="600" height="400"></canvas>

```
This code creates a player object that contains the player's starting position and speed. The drawPlayer function is called on mount, which initializes the canvas context and draws the player's rectangle with a white color. The movePlayer function is bound to the keydown event listener, which checks for arrow key presses and moves the player's position accordingly, within the bounds of the game board.

You can customize the player's dimensions, speed, and color to match your game's requirements.


# Create code to redraw player on keyboard events

Sure, here's an updated code snippet that redraws the player's position on each keyboard event:

```
<script>
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';
  
  let canvas;
  let ctx;
  
  const PLAYER_WIDTH = 50;
  const PLAYER_HEIGHT = 30;
  
  let player = {
    x: canvas.width / 2 - PLAYER_WIDTH / 2,
    y: canvas.height - PLAYER_HEIGHT,
    speed: 5
  };
  
  function drawPlayer() {
    ctx.fillStyle = '#fff'; // Set player color
    ctx.fillRect(player.x, player.y, PLAYER_WIDTH, PLAYER_HEIGHT); // Draw player rectangle
  }
  
  function movePlayer(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowLeft' && player.x > 0) {
      player.x -= player.speed;
    } else if (event.key === 'ArrowRight' && player.x < canvas.width - PLAYER_WIDTH) {
      player.x += player.speed;
    }
    drawPlayer(); // Redraw player on each movement
  }
  
  onMount(() => {
    canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
    ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    window.addEventListener('keydown', movePlayer);
    drawPlayer();
  });
</script>

<canvas width="600" height="400"></canvas>

```
This code updates the movePlayer function to call the drawPlayer function after each player movement, which updates the player's position on the canvas. Now, the player's spaceship should move left and right smoothly in response to keyboard input.


# From now on just show me new code changes and where to place it.  

Okay, sure! Here are the new changes:

Add a clearCanvas function to clear the canvas on each frame:

```
function clearCanvas() {
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
}

```

Add a gameLoop function to redraw the canvas on each frame:

```
function gameLoop() {
  clearCanvas();
  drawPlayer();
  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}
```

Call the gameLoop function on mount, after the drawPlayer function is called:

```
onMount(() => {
  canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
  ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  window.addEventListener('keydown', movePlayer);
  drawPlayer();
  gameLoop();
});
```
These changes will update the game to redraw the canvas on each frame and create a continuous animation loop.

Here's where to place the new code changes in your existing code:

```
<script>
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';
  
  let canvas;
  let ctx;
  
  const PLAYER_WIDTH = 50;
  const PLAYER_HEIGHT = 30;
  
  let player = {
    x: canvas.width / 2 - PLAYER_WIDTH / 2,
    y: canvas.height - PLAYER_HEIGHT,
    speed: 5
  };
  
  function drawPlayer() {
    ctx.fillStyle = '#fff'; // Set player color
    ctx.fillRect(player.x, player.y, PLAYER_WIDTH, PLAYER_HEIGHT); // Draw player rectangle
  }
  
  function movePlayer(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowLeft' && player.x > 0) {
      player.x -= player.speed;
    } else if (event.key === 'ArrowRight' && player.x < canvas.width - PLAYER_WIDTH) {
      player.x += player.speed;
    }
  }
  
  function clearCanvas() {
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  }
  
  function gameLoop() {
    clearCanvas();
    drawPlayer();
    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
  }
  
  onMount(() => {
    canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
    ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    window.addEventListener('keydown', movePlayer);
    drawPlayer();
    gameLoop();
  });
</script>

<canvas width="600" height="400"></canvas>

```







```
<script>
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';
  
  let canvas;
  let ctx;
  
  const PLAYER_WIDTH = 50;
  const PLAYER_HEIGHT = 30;
  
  let player;
  
  function initPlayer() {
    player = {
      x: canvas.width / 2 - PLAYER_WIDTH / 2,
      y: canvas.height - PLAYER_HEIGHT,
      speed: 5
    };
  }
  
  function drawPlayer() {
    ctx.fillStyle = '#fff'; // Set player color
    ctx.fillRect(player.x, player.y, PLAYER_WIDTH, PLAYER_HEIGHT); // Draw player rectangle
  }
  
  function movePlayer(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowLeft' && player.x > 0) {
      player.x -= player.speed;
    } else if (event.key === 'ArrowRight' && player.x < canvas.width - PLAYER_WIDTH) {
      player.x += player.speed;
    }
  }
  
  function clearCanvas() {
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  }
  
  function gameLoop() {
    clearCanvas();
    drawPlayer();
    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
  }
  
  onMount(() => {
    canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
    ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    initPlayer();
    window.addEventListener('keydown', movePlayer);
    drawPlayer();
    gameLoop();
  });
</script>

<canvas width="600" height="400"></canvas>

```
